## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
- This is part of a bigger project of creating a unified platform to interact with AWS services from a various interfaces (WEB,MOBILE,CLI,VOICE) 
- Interactive CLI created using Python 3.
- Still in the works. Should be completed by year end as I am commiting consistently but once a week.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Python 3
- Pip
- Virtualenv


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

- Clone the project
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/darshan-raul/Python-CLI-for-AWS.git pyawscli
    ```
- Change the directory to project directory
    ```
    cd pyawscli
    ```
- Install all the required dependencies
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Run locally
    ```
    python ./awscli.py
    ```


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

If you want to create a pip package out of the code.
[Here are the steps ](https://cloudforte.wordpress.com/2019/05/19/220/)
